## What is Pichon Riviere's Theory of Bonding?
 
Pichon Riviere's theory of bonding is based on the concept of the link, which he defines as "a dynamic structure that unites two or more people in a specific situation, with a common goal and a reciprocal influence". The link is composed of three elements: affiliation (the need to belong and be accepted), cooperation (the need to work together and share resources), and pertinence (the need to have a meaningful role and identity).
 
Pichon Riviere argues that the link is the basis of all human relationships, from the family to the society. He also proposes that the link is a source of learning, as it allows people to exchange information, experiences, and emotions. However, the link can also generate conflicts, as people may have different expectations, needs, and interests. Therefore, Pichon Riviere suggests that the link needs to be constantly revised and renegotiated through dialogue and feedback.
