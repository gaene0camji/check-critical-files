# How to Remove the BIOS Whitelist on Lenovo G450 G550 B550 Laptops
 
If you want to upgrade your wireless card or processor on your Lenovo G450 G550 B550 laptop, you may encounter a problem: the BIOS has a whitelist that prevents you from using any hardware that is not approved by Lenovo. This means that you cannot use any wireless card or processor that is not listed in the BIOS, even if they are compatible with your laptop. This can be frustrating if you want to improve your laptop's performance or functionality.

Fortunately, there is a way to remove the BIOS whitelist on your Lenovo G450 G550 B550 laptop. You can do this by flashing a modified BIOS that has no whitelist restrictions. This will allow you to use any wireless card or processor that fits your laptop's socket and chipset. However, flashing a modified BIOS is risky and may void your warranty, so you should do this at your own risk and responsibility.
 
Here are the steps to remove the BIOS whitelist on your Lenovo G450 G550 B550 laptop:
 
1. Download the modified BIOS file from this link: [https://www.wimsbios.com/biosupdates/lenovo/LenovoG450G550](https://www.wimsbios.com/biosupdates/lenovo/LenovoG450G550). The file name is Lenovo G450 G550 2958 18CN37WW 18CN44WW (V2.53) motherboard BIOS - LenovoG450G550.zip. This file contains a modified version of the 18CN44WW (V2.53) BIOS that has no whitelist. The file was created by TTAV134, a BIOS modder who has removed the whitelist on many Lenovo laptops.
2. Extract the zip file and copy the X32 18CN44WW (V2.53).exe file to a USB flash drive formatted as FAT32.
3. Plug the USB flash drive into your laptop and boot into Windows.
4. Run the X32 18CN44WW (V2.53).exe file as administrator and follow the instructions on the screen. The program will backup your current BIOS and flash the modified BIOS.
5. When the flashing process is done, reboot your laptop and enter the BIOS setup by pressing F2 during startup.
6. Load the default settings by pressing F9 and save and exit by pressing F10.
7. Your laptop should now have a modified BIOS with no whitelist. You can now install any wireless card or processor that is compatible with your laptop.

Note: If you encounter any problems after flashing the modified BIOS, such as boot loops, black screens, or beeps, you can try to restore your original BIOS by using the backup file created by the X32 18CN44WW (V2.53).exe program. The backup file should be located in C:\BIOS\X32 18CN44WW (V2.53)\Backup\Backup.BIN. You can use a tool like Universal BIOS Backup Toolkit or Phoenix Tool to flash the backup file back to your laptop.

Why Upgrade Your Wireless Card or Processor?
 
Upgrading your wireless card or processor can have several benefits for your laptop. Here are some of the reasons why you might want to consider it:

- Upgrading your wireless card can enable you to connect to faster and more reliable WiFi networks, such as WiFi 6, which offer higher speeds, lower latency, and better efficiency. This can improve your online experience, especially for tasks that require high bandwidth or low latency, such as gaming, video conferencing, or streaming.
- Upgrading your processor can boost your laptop's performance, allowing you to run more demanding applications and multitask more smoothly. This can enhance your productivity, creativity, and entertainment. A newer processor can also offer better battery life, security features, and compatibility with newer software and hardware.

How to Upgrade Your Wireless Card or Processor?
 
The process of upgrading your wireless card or processor depends on the type of laptop you have and the type of components you want to use. Here are some general steps to follow:

1. Check your laptop's specifications and compatibility. You can usually find this information on the manufacturer's website or in the user manual. You need to know the model and make of your laptop, the type and size of the wireless card or processor slot, and the supported standards and frequencies.
2. Choose a compatible wireless card or processor. You can search online for reviews and recommendations, or consult with a professional technician. You need to make sure that the wireless card or processor you choose matches the specifications and compatibility of your laptop.
3. Prepare your laptop for the upgrade. You need to backup your data, shut down your laptop, unplug it from the power source, and remove the battery if possible. You also need to have the necessary tools, such as a screwdriver, an anti-static wrist strap, and a soft cloth.
4. Open your laptop and locate the wireless card or processor slot. You may need to remove some screws, panels, or covers to access it. Be careful not to damage any wires or components inside your laptop.
5. Remove the old wireless card or processor and install the new one. You may need to disconnect some cables or antennas from the old wireless card or processor and reconnect them to the new one. Make sure that the new wireless card or processor is securely inserted into the slot and aligned correctly.
6. Close your laptop and restore power. You need to reattach any screws, panels, or covers that you removed earlier. You also need to reconnect the battery and plug in the power cord.
7. Boot up your laptop and install any drivers or software that are required for the new wireless card or processor. You may need to download them from the manufacturer's website or use a CD that came with the component. You may also need to update your BIOS settings or operating system settings to recognize the new wireless card or processor.
8. Test your new wireless card or processor. You can use a WiFi analyzer tool or a benchmarking tool to check the speed, signal strength, and performance of your new wireless card or processor. You can also try using different WiFi networks or applications to see if there is any improvement.

Note: Upgrading your wireless card or processor may void your laptop's warranty or violate its terms of service. You should check with your manufacturer before attempting any upgrade. You should also be aware of the risks involved in opening your laptop and replacing its components. You should do this at your own risk and responsibility.
